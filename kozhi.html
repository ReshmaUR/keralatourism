With its unique culture and friendly ambiance, Kozhikode is a wondrous destination for all.Kozhikode is situated in southern India between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, Kozhikode has been attracting travelers from antiquity. The city is also known by its Anglicized name, Calicut.
                  Lured by the spice trade, Phoenicians, Arabs and Chinese headed for its shores. When Vasco da Gama landed on its shores in 1498, he paved the way for the Dutch, the French and later the English. As the major trading point of eastern spices, Calicut was known as the ‘City of Spices’.The city was founded in 1042 AD. The word Calicut is derived from Calico, hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from Kozhikode.
