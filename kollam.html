                  Kollam (erstwhile Quilon) is a southern district of Kerala, located 70 km north of the state’s capital Thiruvananthapuram. It is flanked by the Arabian sea on the west, Tamil Nadu on the east, Alapuzha and Pathanamthitta districts on the north and Thiruvananthapuram district on the south. Housing a population of over 2.6 million, Kollam is one of the more densely peopled districts of India. The head quarters of the district administration is centred at Kollam City, the district’s capital. Administratively, the district is composed of two revenue divisions viz. Kollam and Punalur with three taluks each under them.Like the rest of Kerala, Kollam is climactically temperate with a generally sunny weather peaking in heat during April-May. The monsoon falls from June to September. The soil is varyingly loamy, laterite and forest at the coastal regions, mainland and the forest areas respectively.
                  The heart land of Kollam is naturally veined by the Ashtamudi lake, a massive, multi-branched water body, which is also a popular boating attraction for tourists.This and the Kollam canal cutting through the city give Kollam a place of prominence in the waterway systems of the country.

                The world’s largest bird sculpture and within it a rock theme park for adventure enthusiasts is what today pays tribute to the mythical bird from the Indian epic Ramayana – Jatayu.

                Legend has it that Jatayu tried to save Sita (wife of Lord Rama) when Ravana, a demon king, was abducting her in his airborne chariot. Jatayu is said to have fought valiantly and fallen on these rocks, grievously injured.

                The Jatayu Adventure Center (Jatayu Earth's Center), at Chadayamangalam, 50 km from Thiruvananthapuram, is a unique combination of artistry, mythology, technology, culture, adventure, leisure, and wellness. The virtual reality museum and the theatrical magic that renders the story of Jatayu add to the magic of the destination.

                A creation of Mr. Rajiv Anchal, this destination is sure to leave each visitor awestruck. The state of the art ropeway offers one a bird’s eye view of God’s Own Country just as the helicopter rides do as well.

                The Jatayu Adventure Center offers the largest adventure park within a natural terrain. Paintball, valley crossing, bouldering, zip line, trekking, archery, rappelling, jumaring and wall climbing are among the myriad activities available here.
