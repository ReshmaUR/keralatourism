                Munnar is a popular hill-station of Kerala perched at an altitude of 1600 metres in the Western Ghats. Famous for its tea estates, various shades of green, blankets of mist and craggy peaks, Munnar is aptly known as the 'Kashmir of South India'.
                Munnar serves as the commercial centre for some of the world's largest tea estates. Besides, Munnar has many protected areas which are home to endemic and highly endangered species like the Nilgiri Thar and the Neelakurinji.
                Situated on the banks of three rivers- Madupetti, Nallathanni and Periavaru, Munnar is also blessed with natural view-points apart from the tea-plantations. Munnar is divided into Old Munnar, where the tourist information office is, and Munnar, where the bus station and most guest houses are located. The Eravikulam National Park, Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary and tea plantations are its major attractions.

              The Eravikulam National Park houses a rich and diverse variety of flora and fauna and is a UNESCO world heritage site. Also known as Rajamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, this place was managed as a game reserve by the Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company before 1971. The control was taken over by the Karnataka Government in 1971, and it was declared a national park in 1978. Elephant, Nilgiri langur, Nilgiri marten, Atlas moth (largest in the world), lion-tailed macaque, small-clawed otter and a rare tiger or leopard are some of the main animal species that can be spotted here.
              The Eravikulam National park is famous for housing the endangered mountain goat of South India, the Nilgiri Tahr. It stands out for the ravishing beauty of its rolling grasslands and sholas, spread over 97 sq km in the Kannan Devan hills. Anamudi, which is the highest peak south of Himalayas at a height of 2695m, stands majestically in the central area of the national park.
