              With woods wrapped in mystery, idly flowing dreamy streams, captivating waterfalls and an exuberant wilderness, Perunthenaruvi is a lesser known gem waiting to get discovered! 

              Situated in the forest region of Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district, one of the major pilgrim centres of South India, Perunthenaruvi allures tourists with its breathtakingly beautiful waterfalls and the dazzling stream that flows to merge with the sacred Pamba River. The locality is the home turf of beehives which have bestowed the place with the title Perunthenaruvi meaning the “River of Honey”. Perhaps it could be because of the presence of a holy temple  (Sabarimala) near, Perumthenaruvi too basks in its own myths.
