                  Lying at the northern tip of Kerala bounded by the Western ghats in the east and Arabian sea in the west; twelve rivers flowing across its terrain, Kasaragod is an enchanting beauty of Nature’s creations.
                  There are different views on the derivation of the name “KASARAGOD”. One view is that it is the combination of two Sanskrit words kaasaara (which means lake or pond) and kroda (which means a place where treasure is kept). Another view is that it is the place where Kaasaraka trees (Strychnos nux vomica or Kaanjiram or Kaaraskara) are in abundance. Both views are relavant as there are large number of rivers, lakes and ponds in the coastal belt of the district besides thick flora consisting of innumerable varieties of trees, shribs etc. particularly plentitude of Kaasaraka trees.
                  The landscape is dominated by the characteristic coconut palms accompanying rolling hills and streams flowing into the sea. The landscape is dotted with tiled-roof buildings, topped with the famous Kasaragod tiles made with the local hard red clay and typically walled with laterite blocks. Older houses are commonly found with elaborate woodwork.

                Built almost 300 years ago, Bekal Fort is considered as one of the largest and most preserved forts in Kerala. Nestled in the lap of nature, Bekal Fort is a historic fort surrounded by a beautiful beach offering an enchanting view of Arabian Sea from its high observation tower where once the cannons were placed. The beautiful walkway, illuminated beach and the grand architecture of the Bekal Fort make this place a favourite among the masses. The fort was featured in the popular A R Rahman song ' Tu hi re'.
                The Bekal fort is a keyhole-shaped lofty structure that stands still against the rocky shores of sea amusing its visitors with its finesse. The whole purpose of erecting this structure by Shivappa Nayaka of Bednore in the year 1650 was pure of defence. The location has been a witness to an uninterrupted history with changing several seats of power from Indian royal dynasties to the rule of refined Sultans and surviving the colonial era of British Raj. It is the largest fort in Kerala, spread over an area of 40 acres. Located in the Bekal Village of Kasaragod District of Kerala.
