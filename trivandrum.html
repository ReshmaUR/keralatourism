                  Thiruananthapuram, the jewel in the emerald necklace that Kerala is for the Indian sub-continent, must surely have Parasuramanbeen a “must see” destination for ages, long before National Geographic Traveller classified it as one. Surely long before Sage Parasurama , according to local legend, threw his divine battle axe from Kanyakumari to Gokarnam to west Kerala, God’s own land, from the Varuna the sea god; before the times of Mahabali the democratic and just ruler of this wonderful land who was sent down to the netherworld through deceit. It doesnt take any flights of fancy to imagine that this land fired the imaginations of intrepid travellers and explorers like Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Marco Polo, Fa Hien, and quite possibly, countless others from the pages of history, recorded or not.

                  Tourism has contributed heavily to the economy of Thiruvananthapuram. The entire tourism package such as hill stations, back waters, beaches, lagoons, and wildlife sanctuaries are present in the district.

                Set amid a beautiful setting about 10 km away from the calm and quiet hamlet of Varkala in Kerala, Varkala Beach, also known as Papanasam Beach, is a beautiful stretch of sand renowned for its solitude unlike other commercial beaches of Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The backdrop Arabian Sea against the cliffs of Kerala is a unique one since these sedimentary formation peaks are not found anywhere in the otherwise flat coastline of Kerala.

                The beach itself is divided into two parts, the southern area of the beach lying at the end of the road leading from Janardhana Swamy Temple regarded as sacred by Hindus. However, if you are a tourist, the north part of the beach right at the bottom of the cliff is worth going renowned for its natural mineral spring.

                The water of Varkala Beach is regarded to own medicinal and curative properties. A dip in the hoy water is said to cleanse the body of impurities and all sins and thus the name Papanasam Beach meaning 'Destroyer of Sins'.

                Sunsets at the Varkala Beach are especially pristine and call for a serene walk along the beach. Also if you are a seafood lover, then the place is a paradise for you. The eating joints nearby offer some of India's best moth watering and affordable food.

              Anjengo Fort is forever remembered in the pantheons of history as the location of the first trade settlement of the East India Company in Kerala. Legend has it that the English were given this site by the Queen of Attingal for trade purposes. Anjengo or Anjuthenguwas a small stretch of land with five coconut trees at the time and the fort was named after the same.  The old English Fort that once stood here would be constantly attacked by foreign powers for centuries.The town contains old Portuguese-style churches, a lighthouse, a 100-year-old convent and school, tombs of Dutch and British sailors and soldiers, and the remains of the Anchuthengu Fort.
              Today, this place provides one with a majestic architectural marvel situated in a picturesque setting. Located near the popular tourist haunt of Varkala, you have a secluded beach on one side and a backwater stretch on the other. The coconut groves that dot the shore add to the destination’s charm and make it among the finest picnic spots in the area. One can simply sit and watch fishermen diligently go about their work, following traditions and customs that have never changed regardless of whose flag was raised at the summit of the Fort.

              Thiruvananthapuram Zoo, one of the oldest in the country, was established as an adjunct to the Museum in 1859 by the erstwhile Maharaja of Travancore in order to attract more visitors. The typical iron barred, cement floored, dingy animal cages built in the past still stand as monuments of the royal style and architectural supremacy rather than being proper housing for animal. As these cages are outmoded with the changed concepts of zoo management, they are being renovated/replaced by open moated, spacious, nearly natural enclosures in phased manner. This modernization project being implemented since 1995-96 is going on.
              Spread over 30 acres of land and located in the temple city of Thiruvananthapuram, the zoo offers rare opportunity for the visitors to experience and enjoy unparalleled picturesque and panoramic sylvan surroundings besides vivid animal collections. Zoo has two natural lakes where more than 60 species of free ranging birds including migratory birds can be seen throughout the year. More than 100 different species of both exotic and indigenous plant varieties inside the zoo provide an excellent ambience to the visitors. The zoo has more than 100 different species of animals from all over India and abroad.
